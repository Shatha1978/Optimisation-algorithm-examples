# Optimisation-algorithm-examples


A small set of iterative optimisation algorithms to illustrate the paper entitled "???" submited to [Swarm and Evolutionary Computation](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/swarm-and-evolutionary-computation "Swarm and Evolutionary Computation's homepage").

We focus on stochastic algorithms only, in particular evolutionary algorithms, PSO, simulated annnealing and test them using [common test functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_functions_for_optimization "Common test functions for optimisation").
